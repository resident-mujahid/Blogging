        <p>Long exposure photography offers a who new way of seeing the world around you. Once you get started you may become totally hooked. It isn’t a cheap form of photography, to begin with, but once those initial costs are taken care of, you can photograph
            as much as you want, providing you take care of your gear.</p>

        <p>If you are new to long exposure photography it can seem like a very confusing process to get your head around. Ultimately it does become much easier, but there are some common questions that most people first ask. You might have some yourself.
            Over the years I’ve been teaching long exposure photography, here are the seven most common questions that I get.</p>
        <h1> What is long exposure photography?</h1>
        <p>Typically, long exposure usually refers to any photography that requires a tripod. For most photos, you can hand hold the camera. However, there will always be places that are too dark and in order to get a good image you will have to sacrifice
            ISO and turn it up a lot. That will enable you to get a fast enough shutter speed to capture the image. Increasing your ISO does introduce noise and for many situations, it is not good to do that. This is when you should put your camera on
            a tripod. When you do that, you are starting to do long exposures. Typically, you would do long exposures for night photography or if you are using special filters. However, when most people talk about long exposure photography they are usually
            referring to the use of ND filters that block many stops of light which will allow you to keep the shutter open for a long time.</p>

        <p>In Angels and Demons (2000), Dan Brown introduces Robert Langdon, the Harvard symbologist who would later star in Brown’s worldwide best seller The Da Vinci Code (2003). The two books share numerous characteristics. Though fictional, both novels
            claim to be built upon a base of researched facts. Both seek to revise aspects of generally accepted histories, especially those related to the Catholic Church and its relationship to free thought. And both books put Langdon in the middle
            of violent interactions among shadowy factions, clashes whose outcomes may well determine the future course of Western civilization. The two books differ in setting, threat, and focus. While The Da Vinci Code tackles ancient speculations about
            the Holy Grail, Angels and Demons involves more standard thriller fare. It puts science and religion into conflict by reviving the Illuminati, a secret society of scientists and freethinkers whose relationship with the Catholic Church has
            long been, Brown indicates, intimate, tangled, and not fully known. This secret society returns as a threat when the major church leaders are gathered at the Vatican to elect a new pontiff. Increasing this centuries-old tension is a more specific
            threat: the Illuminati claim to have stolen a rare sample of antimatter and hidden it somewhere in the Vatican. It is highly explosive if it comes in contact with normal matter, and it will do so when a protective magnetic field runs out in
            twenty-four hours. Add to this the fact that the four preferred candidates for the papacy have been kidnapped, and the result is that Robert Langdon must decipher a grand puzzle and save the day while half a dozen clocks are ticking. Although
            the novel’s style is melodramatic, and its exposition and moral judgments are heavy-handed, Angels and Demons remains a first-rate thriller. Angels and Demons Extended Summary</p>
        <p>Daniel Gerhard "Dan" Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of thriller fiction who is best known for the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code.[2] Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period,[3] and feature the recurring
            themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), and Inferno
            (2013), have been adapted into films. Brown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his
            books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and says that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate" and suggests that the book may be
            used "as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith."</p>
